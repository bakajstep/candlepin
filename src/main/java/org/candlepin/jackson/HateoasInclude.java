/**
 * The HateoasInclude annotation is used in conjunction with the HateoasBeanPropertyFilter and
 * jackson's JsonFilter annotation to determine which properties are to be included in the
 * JSON-serialized output of a model object.
 *
 * The HateoasInclude annotation may be applied to a class, a property or a method and will be
 * checked in that order. When applied to the class, all properties within the class will be
 * included. Otherwise, only the properties with the annotation will be included.
 *
 * Additionally, if the annotation is applied to an accessor in the form of "get{property}" or
 * "is{property}", the property will be included as if it the annotation were applied directly to it.
